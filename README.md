This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: race conditions.  The `bug.sh` script shows how concurrently writing to a file can lead to unpredictable results, while `bugSolution.sh` offers a solution using proper locking mechanisms.  The race condition is demonstrated by two background processes attempting to write to the same file simultaneously; the final output is not deterministic. This showcases the importance of careful consideration of concurrency when dealing with shared resources in shell scripts.
